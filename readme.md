# Discreet Flat

Discreet Flat is a dark [Cinnamon](https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon) theme trying to get the best out of flat design without removing usability.

It was originally based on the [default Cinnamon theme](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-themes/blob/master/usr/share/themes/Linux%20Mint/cinnamon/cinnamon.css).
